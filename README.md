# Classifying glasses or not glasses using CNN

The dataset of celebrity faces, CelebA, is used in this project.

The dataset is available at: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

I am not uploading a copy of the data with this, so in order to run this, the dataset need to be downloaded and the images and labels should be pointed to variables path and labelPath respectively. No other changes to the code are needed in order to run this code.
